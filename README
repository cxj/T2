This is a punch clock like timer, designed to make it extremely easy for the user to start and stop time accumulated for listed projects.  I originally wrote this in 1991 using Sun's XView toolkit (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XView) on a SPARCstation IPC.  I was working as a software engineer for a company that tracked development effort by various projects for payroll / timesheets, which were always a pain in the neck to fill out after the fact.  So I wrote this small, light applicaiton that would always be visible on my screen that I could easily clock-in / clock-out from as I worked on various projects.

A few years later in 1994, I was working at a different company where IBM's AIX using Motif/CDE was the desktop environment for software developers who wanted it (other choice was Windows 3.11 -- ick!).  I had a similar need to track my time, but was not too interested in learning the AIX flavor of Motif's primitive (compared to elegant XView) API.  Instead, I discovered Tcl and Tk, and learned just enough to hack this thing together.

Hence, this is probably the worst, ugliest piece of code I've written in the last 20 years.  It's been tweaked a few times since, but mostly I've not had the interest in becoming a Tcl/Tk guru to make it beautiful.  It works for me, and that's enough.

If you would like to improve it, suggest changes or submit them, please do.  I hope you find it useful.
